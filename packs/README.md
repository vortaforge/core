**Datapacks were retired on 2026-11-05.** Every pack, datapack generator,
linter and test harness was archived and disarmed under `../archived/`
(registry: `../archived/archive.json`, schema v2, every entry
`"disarmed": true`), and `datapacks.disabled.json` (`"enabled": false`) is the
kill switch that keeps it that way.

Why: no type safety, no security model, no debugging, no warnings, a low review
score — bad enough that it would have been better not to ship it at all. The
maintainer also hit real problems as a plain player using a datapack with no
client mod installed, and the same class of problems kept coming back in pull
requests.

`scripts/datapack_guard.py` refuses new datapack content here in
`pre-commit`, `pre-push` and CI. This README is the only file this directory
is allowed to contain.
