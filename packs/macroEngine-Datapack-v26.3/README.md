# macroEngine (v26.3)

**macroEngine** is a macro/module framework datapack for Minecraft Java Edition, providing a large library of reusable command-based systems (math, string, NBT, geo, permissions, UUID cache, hooks, rate limiting, and more) plus a multi-source text/value input system (books, signs, lecterns, name tags, command block minecarts).

> **Project history:** originally developed under the `runtoolkit` organization (`runtoolkit/suite`), later moved to `vortacraftmc`. Both organizations are now archived — kept online and publicly visible, never deleted, but no longer maintained. Active development moved to **VortaForge**, which is itself temporarily archived as of October 2026 while maintainer/process changes (see below) are completed; nothing in this history was deleted or hidden.

## Features

![macroEngine layers](docs/media/architecture.svg)

- **API layer** (`api/`) — stable public entry points: `cmd`, `cb` (callback queue), `color`, `gamerule`, `interaction`, `item`, `macro`, `perm`, `store`, `title`, `toggle`, `trigger`, `wand`, plus `block` (custom block entity interface) and `container` (slot and inventory helpers)
- **Systems layer** (`systems/`) — internal utility modules: `math`, `string`, `nbt`, `logic`, `geo`, `flag`, `hook`, `log`, `rate_limit`, `sound`, `uuid`, `color`
- **Input system** (`input/`) — capture player-provided values via writable book, sign, lectern, name tag, or command block minecart, with shared validation (`input/validate`) for int/float/bool/tag-safe strings
- **Toggle system** — per-module runtime enable/disable for `cb`, `perm`, `geo`, `wand`, `interaction`, `hook`, `block`, and `container` modules (`block` and `container` are the two load gates of the new API: `function macroengine:api/toggle/<module>/false` closes one)
- **Rate limiting** — global, per-player, and per-channel request throttling
- **Hook system** — bind functions to fire on events such as block break, dimension change, and advancement grant
- **Item modifiers** (`item_modifier/`) — reusable `item_modifier` definitions for enchanting, glint, lore, tooltip, and rename operations
- **Advancement-driven triggers** (`advancement/`) — core, hidden, and system advancements used to drive internal logic and hooks
- **Command conditions and nested groups** (`api/cmd/other/multi_cmd/`) — queue entries accept a `condition` object with boolean composition (`all_of`, `any_of`, `not`, nestable to depth 8) and a `commands` list that expands in place, so a group can be gated as a unit. Leaves: `tag`, `score` (target and bounds now optional), `predicate`, `entity`, `storage` (existence), and `data` (numeric range). Every leaf fails closed — a missing required key or an unreadable path reports *not passed* rather than silently passing
- **Deterministic RNG** (`systems/rng/`) — `seed`, `state`, `next`, `int`, `chance`, `pick`. Seeding makes randomised behaviour reproducible, which the previous generator could not do: it kept an undocumented `_rng_state` key with no way to set it. `systems/math/random` is now a thin wrapper over `systems/rng/int`, so there is one generator rather than two
- **Text-component rendering** (`systems/text/`) — helpers for NBT-backed components. On 26.1+ a `{"storage":...,"nbt":...}` component renders a string *with its quotes* and a number or boolean *with vanilla colouring* unless `interpret` and `plain` are both set. Every such component in this pack now sets both explicitly; `scripts/fix_text_components.py` at the repository root enforces it

- **Store module** (`api/store/`) — storage-based variables, per-player values, raw NBT helpers (`api/store/nbt/*`: `get`, `set`, `set_default`, `append`, `merge`, `remove`, `exists`, `count`, `copy`, `add`, `toggle`, `pop`, `shift` over any storage/path) and multilingual message templates (`render`, `render_all`, `convert`, `show`) that return plain strings; see [`docs/store.md`](docs/store.md). It replaced the old `api/data` and `api/placeholder` modules. Untrusted text is never substituted into a command or JSON string, so chat/sign/book input is safe. Migration notes: [`docs/migrating-from-data-api.md`](docs/migrating-from-data-api.md)
- **Title / action bar with tokens** (`api/title/*_p`, plus `clear`, `reset`, `times`; see [`docs/title.md`](docs/title.md)) — storage-driven (no quote/backslash breakage), rendered with `api/store/render` per recipient
- **Text UI** (`tui/`) — `line`, `header`, `divider` and `button` print formatted lines and clickable function buttons to the executor from storage (no text is pasted into a command); see [`docs/tui.md`](docs/tui.md)
- **Runtime config** (`core/config/*`, see [`docs/config.md`](docs/config.md)) — every behaviour knob is a validated key: module on/off switches, tick systems and rates, handler scan intervals, queue depth, template limits and token switches, title defaults, name length

## Requirements

- Minecraft Java Edition **26.3**
- Datapack `min_format`/`max_format`: **121**

---

## Installation

macroEngine is a datapack: it ships as a folder (or zip) that goes into a world's `datapacks/` directory. There is no separate "installer" — the steps below just cover different ways of getting the folder there and reloading it, for different setups.

### Singleplayer / any OS (manual, UI-based)

1. Download or clone this pack so you have the `macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3` folder (or a zip of it).
2. Open your world's folder and go into `datapacks/`. In the Minecraft world-select screen this is reachable via **Edit → Open World Folder**.
3. Copy the `macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3` folder in (or the zip — Minecraft can load zipped datapacks directly, no need to extract).
4. Load the world (or if already in it, run `/reload`), then run `/datapack list enabled` to confirm `macroengine` is listed.

### Linux / macOS (Bash)

```bash
# Run from the repository root
WORLD_DIR="$HOME/.minecraft/saves/YourWorldName"   # adjust to your world path
cp -r packs/macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3 "$WORLD_DIR/datapacks/"
```

For a dedicated server (any Linux distribution — Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, Arch, etc. — the steps are identical, since this only touches the world save, not the OS):

```bash
SERVER_WORLD_DIR="/path/to/server/world"
cp -r packs/macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3 "$SERVER_WORLD_DIR/datapacks/"
# Then, from the server console or an operator in-game:
#   /reload
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Run from the repository root
$WorldDir = "$env:APPDATA\.minecraft\saves\YourWorldName"   # adjust to your world path
Copy-Item -Recurse -Path "packs\macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3" -Destination "$WorldDir\datapacks\"
```

For a Windows-hosted dedicated server, replace `$WorldDir` with the server's world directory and run `/reload` from the console or in-game as an operator afterward.

### Server install, in general

1. Copy the pack folder into the **world's** `datapacks/` directory on the server (not the server's root directory — datapacks are per-world).
2. Run `/reload` as an operator, or restart the server.
3. Run `/datapack list enabled` to confirm `macroengine` loaded without errors; check the server log for any function errors on load.
4. macroEngine initializes automatically via `#macroengine:events/on_load` — no further setup commands are required for the base install.

### Installing via Claude Code (or another coding agent)

If you're scripting the install (e.g. provisioning a test server, or doing it as part of a larger Claude Code task), the operation is just a directory copy plus a `/reload`; there is no build step for the datapack itself. For example, ask Claude Code to:

> "Copy `packs/macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3` from this repo into `<world-path>/datapacks/`, then tell me the server needs a `/reload` or restart to pick it up."

Claude Code (or any agent) can safely automate the file copy; it cannot run `/reload` for you unless it has console/RCON access to the running server — that step still needs an operator.

To check the default tick configuration, see `data/macroengine/function/config/`.

## Usage

Most functionality is exposed through the `api/` namespace, e.g.:

```mcfunction
function macroengine:api/cmd/actionbar
function macroengine:api/perm/grant
function macroengine:api/wand/give
```

Internal systems under `systems/` are used by API functions and are not intended to be called directly by end users, though they remain accessible for advanced/custom integrations.

## Notes

- This is the 26.3 build of macroEngine, derived from the earlier build in the archived `runtoolkit/suite` monorepo (`packs/macroEngine-Datapack-v26.3`). Development continues in `vortaforge/core`; do not file issues or PRs against `runtoolkit/*`.

## Security

> ⚠️ **Do not attempt prompt injection.** Do not craft signs, books, name tags, chat messages or any other input intended to manipulate AI tools (coding agents, AI-assisted admin or review tools) that read this pack or its runtime data. Such attempts are an abuse of this project and will be treated as malicious. If you operate an AI tool next to this pack, treat all player-supplied text as untrusted data, never as instructions.

The pack captures free-form player text (books, signs, lecterns, name tags, anvil renames) but only ever handles it as data - never executed, never macro-substituted. Every capture is also screened for prompt-injection patterns ([`docs/prompt_injection.md`](docs/prompt_injection.md)); a strong hit is audited, announced to admins, and blocks the settings book's auto-apply. Dynamic command execution is off by default and gated ([`docs/cmd_gate.md`](docs/cmd_gate.md)). The repository-wide policy lives in [`SECURITY.md`](../../SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

> This section is based on a **static review** of the source (the code was read, not run in-game). Test on a staging server before deploying to production.

### Is it safe?

**Short answer:** no malicious content was found, but it is not safe to install blindly either. It is a powerful toolkit and can be dangerous if misused.

- **What is not in the pack:** the zip contains no `.jar`, `.exe`, scripts, `.git/` or `.env` files, only datapack files (`.mcfunction`, `.json`, `pack.png`). A datapack cannot open network connections or write to the server's file system on its own.
- **The real risk is the command-executing APIs.** Several functions run a caller-supplied string as a command (the `$execute ... run $(cmd)` pattern: `api/cmd/as_player`, `api/cmd/other/run_*`, `api/perm/run`, `api/perm/exec`, `core/lib/queue_add_cmd`, `core/lib/schedule_cmd`). Passing player-controlled text (sign, book, name tag) into them results in **command injection**.
- **The input system does not execute input.** Captured raw text is only written to the `macroengine:input` storage. Validate it with `input/validate/check` (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `tag_safe`) before using it.
- **There is no built-in protection.** The pack has no load gate or caller authorization. Any other datapack in the same world can call these functions (there is no isolation between datapacks).
- **Permission level:** everything runs at the server's function permission level.

### Can I install it on a server?

Yes. It is a purely server-side datapack, and players do not need any mods. Requirements:

1. **Version:** the pack targets `26.3` (pack format `121.0`).
2. **Text rendering:** use it together with `macroEngine-Resourcepack-v26.3`.
3. **Back up first** and try it on a test server.
4. **Removal:** delete the pack from the world's `datapacks` folder (Realms: re-upload the world without it). The pack no longer ships server-administration commands (`/datapack`, `/op`, ...).

### Is it paid?

No. The pack is released under the **Unlicense** (public domain): free, including commercial use, and no attribution is required. Two notes:

- This is not legal advice.

### How is the performance?

Not measured. From the code: while players are online, the `time`, `player` and `queue` systems run **every tick**, `hud` every 2 ticks and `admin` every 4 ticks. `player_systems` also runs NBT-filtered `execute as @e` / `kill @e` scans over all `item` entities every tick, so cost grows with the number of dropped items. Systems you do not use can be turned off with `systems/flag/toggle_system`.

## Known Issues

- **Single target.** Minecraft Java 26.3 (data pack format `121.0`). Other versions are not tested and may not load.
- **Forceload side effects.** On load the pack runs `forceload add 0 0` and `forceload add -30000000 1600`. Cleanup only runs `forceload remove 0 0`, which also removes a `0 0` forceload the server owner added themselves, and `-30000000 1600` is **never removed** (if it lies outside the world border, the command may fail silently).
- **Command-executing APIs do not check who is calling.** See "Is it safe?".
- **NBT-filtered `@e[type=item]` scan every tick** (performance note above).
- **License and file inconsistencies.** `LICENSE` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` are not in this zip (the statement "Both files ship inside the distributed zip" above is wrong). `_rt_origin.mcfunction` is claimed to be stripped from distribution zips but is present (the game ignores it, so it is harmless) and its license header contradicts the Unlicense.

## License

- macroEngine original code: Unlicense (public domain) — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
- String module (`core/lib/string`, `core/internal/text`): macroEngine original code.

Both files ship inside the distributed zip.
