"""datapack_guard - fail-closed gate against new datapacks, archived-code
revival, and blocklisted accounts.

This repository retired its datapack programme on 2026-11-05 (see
archived/archive.json). This script is the machine-enforced half of that
decision: it runs before a commit, on every push, and in CI, and it refuses
anything that would bring a datapack - or a datapack developer who is on the
blocklist - back in.

Modes (combine freely; at least one source of changes is required)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  --staged                 read `git diff --cached`
  --base REF               read `git diff REF...HEAD` (CI pull requests)
  --files-from PATH        read newline-separated paths, optionally
                           "STATUS<TAB>path" pairs (STATUS in A/M/D/R/C/T)
  --audit-refs             check every local branch/tag name against the
                           blocklist's ref_patterns (used by the sync job)
  --check-archive          run scripts/repo/check_archive.py and treat its errors
                           as this script's errors (default in CI mode)

Policy flags
------------
  --protect                block new/changed datapack content (default ON)
  --blocklist              block blocked authors, committers and PR authors
  --pr                     pull-request rules: datapack edits in a PR are
                           blocked outright; a `datapack-approved` label is
                           required to override (fail-closed if unknown)
  --push                   pre-push rules: block force-push to main, block
                           commits by blocked accounts, block new packs
  --warn-only              report, exit 0 (advisory jobs only)
  --json                   machine-readable output
  --report PATH            also write the JSON report to PATH
  --override               explicit maintainer override (never implied;
                           pre-push hooks never pass this)
  --repo-root PATH         repository root (default: script's parent)

Exit codes
----------
  0  pass (or --warn-only)
  1  blocked
  2  usage / environment error (treated as a failure, never as a pass)

Design notes
------------
* Fail-closed: an unreadable blocklist, a malformed pattern, an unknown change
  status or a missing git ref is an error, not a skip. The old datapack
  immutability lock was removed because it "enforced nothing"; this one is
  wired into pre-commit, pre-push and two workflows, and every wiring point is
  itself asserted by scripts/tests/test_datapack_guard.py.
* No network access, no code execution. Only stdlib.
* Nothing here is a security boundary against someone with repository admin
  rights; it is a guard against accidents, AI/bot automation and casual
  drive-by PRs, and it makes every exception explicit and reviewable.
