# Makes sure the runtime config is complete and applied. One cheap check per tick: the revision
# marker written by config.mcfunction plus two applied scores. It covers worlds loaded by an older
# version, where the load pipeline does not run again and new keys would never be created.
# Adding a config key means adding it to config.mcfunction and bumping config_rev there.
