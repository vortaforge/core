# macroengine:systems/diagnostics/checks/modules
# Internal: called by systems/diagnostics/collect. Verifies the apply contract for every module:
# macroengine:engine modules.<name> must exist, be a byte 0b/1b, and equal config.module_<name>.
# Counts enabled and disabled modules into #macroengine.dg_on / #macroengine.dg_off.
#
# The names below are constants written here, never player input, so they are safe to substitute
# into the macro lines of checks/module_one. Keep this list in sync with core/config/apply.
