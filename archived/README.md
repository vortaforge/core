# archived/

Everything in this directory is **frozen, reference-only and hard-disarmed**.
Nothing under `archived/` is built, merged, zipped, linted, tested or executed
by the Gradle build or by CI. `settings.gradle` does not scan this directory.

**Status: the datapack programme in `vortaforge/core` is retired (2026-11-05).**
`packs/` is empty, `archived/archive.json` lists every retired project with
`"disarmed": true`, and `datapacks.disabled.json` is the switch that keeps it
that way. New datapack content is refused in pre-commit, pre-push and CI by
`scripts/datapack_guard.py`.

## Why

Datapacks, as shipped here, had:

* **no type safety** — every value that crosses a function call, a storage
  read, a scoreboard comparison or a macro expansion is an untyped string that
  nothing checks at load time or at run time;
* **no security model** — stored-string command execution runs at
  `function-permission-level` with no authentication boundary, and each pack
  needed its own opt-in gate (`docs/dynamic-command-gate.md`, archived) that a
  player could not verify;
* **no debugging** — no trace, breakpoint, log or state inspection beyond
  hand-written `tellraw`;
* **no warnings** — malformed references and wrong pack formats failed silently
  or at run time instead of at build time;
* and it **scored low in review**.

It was bad enough that it would have been better had it not shipped at all. The
maintainer gave up on it after hitting real problems as a plain player using
a datapack **with no client mod installed**, and the same class of problems
kept showing up in pull requests.

*Türkçe:* Datapack'de tip güvenliği, güvenlik modeli, hata ayıklama, uyarılar
ve birçok önemli şey olmadığı ve düşük puanlı olduğu için vazgeçiyorum.
Client'a mod kurmadan datapack kullanırken bile sorunlar yaşadım ve PR'lerde de
aynı sorunlar çıktı; olmasaydı daha iyi olurdu.

## Layout

| Path | Contents | Registry ids |
|---|---|---|
| `archived/packs/` | The 12 retired packs (11 datapacks + 1 resource pack), moved verbatim with their git history. | `dailybonus` … `vf-macro` |
| `archived/tools/` | Datapack generators, linters and test harnesses: `dpgen/`, `datapack-lint/`, `build-release/`, `ward/` (with its workflow), `datapack-blocker/` (Fabric mod). | `dpgen`, `datapack-lint`, `build-release`, `ward`, `datapack-blocker-mod` |
| `archived/build/` | The datapack Gradle logic that used to live in the root `build.gradle`, extracted **verbatim, as separate files** (see `probe.lock` for the exact source line ranges). | `build-*` |
| `archived/examples/` | `template-datapack/` — the example pack template. | `template-datapack` |
| `archived/docs/` | `dynamic-command-gate.md`, `static-analysis-findings-2026-10-30.md`. | `dynamic-command-gate-doc`, `static-analysis-findings` |
| `archived/merge-manifest.json` | The merge manifest that used to drive `mergeDatapacks`. Kept next to the packs it merged. | — |
| `archived/archive.json` | The registry (schema: `archive.schema.json`, `schema_version` 2). | — |
| `archived/datapacks.disabled` | Human-readable marker for the kill switch. | — |

### `archived/build/` — the extracted Gradle logic

| File | Was `build.gradle` section |
|---|---|
| `origin-watermark-helpers.gradle` | 3 — `findOriginWatermarks`, `findPackDirs`, `findMissingWatermarks`, `showOriginWatermarks`, `cleanOriginWatermarks`, `checkOriginWatermarks` |
| `pack-packaging-helpers.gradle` | 3b — `copyDirRecursive`, `zipDirectory`, sensitive/generated/Ward path filters |
| `zip-packs.gradle` | 4 — `zipPacks` |
| `pack-validation-helpers.gradle` | 5 — `vc*` helpers (namespace, pack format, function reference resolution) |
| `check-packs.gradle` | 5 — `checkPacks`, `printPackList`, `printPackFormats` |
| `merge-datapacks.gradle` | 6 — `mergeDatapacks` |

These were split out on 2026-11-05 so the live `build.gradle` contains no
datapack code at all. They are **not applied**; they are the exact record of
how the packs were validated, merged and packaged, and the starting point if
the decision is ever reversed. The copies are byte-identical to the original
sections (only a provenance header was prepended), and
`scripts/tests/test_repo_invariants.py` asserts the important parts (watermark
guards, Ward-test exclusions, dry-run safety) against these files.

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/check_archive.py            # authoritative registry check
./gradlew checkArchive                      # same, through Gradle
./gradlew checkDatapackSwitch               # kill switch engaged?
python3 scripts/datapacks_disable.py verify # switch + marker + registry + empty packs/
./gradlew printArchiveList                  # human-readable list
```

`check_archive.py` fails when:

* the schema version is not 2, a required field is missing, an unknown field is
  present, an enum/date/id is invalid, or `reason` is missing;
* an entry is not `"disarmed": true` (a missing `disarmed` is an error, so a v1
  registry cannot silently re-enable code);
* a `kind: "datapack"` entry does not set `"is_datapack": true`;
* `path` escapes the repository, does not exist, or does not start with
  `archived/`;
* a `.github/` path or a workflow file would live under `archived/`;
* an `original_path` still exists (the move was incomplete);
* a directory under `archived/packs/` or `archived/tools/` has no registry
  entry, or a registry path has no directory (bijection);
* `packs/` is not empty, `packs/merge-manifest.json` exists, or any retired
  tool path is live again;
* `settings.gradle` scans `archived/`.

`-PcheckArchiveStrict=true` / `--strict` turns warnings (e.g. a missing
successor) into failures.

## The kill switch

| Piece | Path | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Switch | `datapacks.disabled.json` | `"enabled": false`. Missing or unreadable counts as disabled. |
| Marker | `archived/datapacks.disabled` | Human-readable explanation. |
| Token | `datapacks.disabled.json#reenable_token` | Required to re-enable. |
| CLI | `scripts/datapacks_disable.py` | `status`, `disable`, `enable`, `verify`. |
| Guard | `scripts/datapack_guard.py` | Blocks new datapack content anywhere live. |

Re-enabling is deliberate:

```bash
python3 scripts/datapacks_disable.py enable \
    --token VORTAFORGE-DATAPACKS-2026-11-05-DISARMED \
    --reason "why this is being re-enabled, in one sentence"
```

That flips the switch but does **not** move packs back. A restore still needs
each project moved out of `archived/`, its registry entry removed, its
`original_path` cleared, and the `archived/build/*.gradle` sections re-applied
by hand (they are kept for exactly that reason). Treat it as a new project
proposal, with the review the old one never had.

## Rules

- **Do not delete anything here.** The registry, the packs and the extracted
  Gradle logic are the record of a decision.
- **No new content.** A PR that adds or edits anything under `archived/` is
  expected to change `archive.json` in the same commit; CI reviews the diff
  against the registry.
- **Archived projects are never built or shipped.** If a build task starts
  looking at `archived/`, that is a bug in the build.
- **Licences and provenance stay intact**: each project's `LICENSE`, the
  `_vc_origin.mcfunction` watermarks, `NOTICE.md` and `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
- **A workflow must never live under `archived/`** — GitHub runs whatever is in
  `.github/workflows/`, so `archived/tools/ward/ward.yml` is inert by
  construction. `check_archive.py` enforces this.

## ⚠️ Warning — a Minecraft server is started in exactly one place, and it is archived

Warning: `archived/tools/ward/` (formerly `scripts/ward_ci.sh`, `scripts/ward_guard.py`
and `.github/workflows/ward.yml`) is the only thing in this repository that ever
started a Minecraft server, via the Ward (mcward) harness. It is now inactive:
the workflow is not under `.github/workflows/` any more, so GitHub will not run
it. **Never run `ward_ci.sh` on a developer machine, a production host or next
to a real world.** Nothing else in the repository starts, connects to or tests
against a Minecraft server.
