# macroengine:api/store/player/show
# Reads the executor's per-player value (api/store/player/get) and prints it to @s with tellraw.
#
# INPUT  macroengine:store in.name (string)
# OUTPUT macroengine:store out.value (same as api/store/player/get); a chat line for @s
# RETURN 1 when the value exists and was shown, 0 when it is unset or in.name is missing or invalid.
#
# The value is read straight from storage by an NBT text component with "interpret": false,
# so strings are shown as written and numbers, lists and compounds as SNBT. Nothing is
# ever stored as a text component; the component only exists while the line is printed.
#
# Usage:
#   data modify storage macroengine:store in set value {name:"shop.price"}
#   function macroengine:api/store/player/show
